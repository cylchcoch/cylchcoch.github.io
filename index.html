			<h3>Help us tackle period poverty and keep our girls in school</h3>
			<p>A community wide project providing sanitary items and information to local school girls. One in ten women live in period poverty in the UK. This means one in ten women cannot afford the amount of sanitary items they need each month. True, this does not affect the majority of young girls, but what does is the lack of access to sanitary products in schools.</p><p> No young girl should have to miss school because of her period, or feel uncomfortable talking about it with others. So that is our mission, to make the school environment an easier place to be for girls when they are on their period, through supportive information and access to products. </p>

		<h1>Who we are</h1>
		<p>Cylch Coch is a project based within communities of North Wales. With the donations and fundraising efforts of the local people we will provide secondary schools with sanitary products and information. Our aim is to tackle period poverty and taboo, to keep young girls in school and for them to feel comfortable to talk about their period. Together we will raise confident young women.</p>
